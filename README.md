# Multiplayer Mini Games
Here I used python to create a variet of multiplayer mini games. Following are the game rules:

Tic Tac Toe
The winning conditions of this game are the same as the traditional tic tac toe game, which is filling the entire row/column/diagonal. The twist is the size of the board is customizable from 2 < size < 11.

Notakto
This is a tic tac toe game variant that is played across 3x3 boards: Board A, board B, and board C. There are 2 players and both players play the same piece: X. Each player take turns placing an X on the board in a vacant place. If a board has 3 X in a row, column, or diagonal, the board is dead and it cannot be played anymore. The game ends when all the boards contain 3 X in a row, column, or diagonal, at which point the player to have made the last move loses the game. Unlike tic-tac-toe, there will always be a player who wins any game of Notakto.

Connect Four
Connect four is a connection game in which two players take turns dropping discs into a (6 x 7) board, i.e., 6 rows x 7 columns. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs. This is a custom version of this game that allows the players to play it on a general (r x c) sized board. For the standard size we have r = 6 and c = 7, where r represents the number of rows and c the number of columns on the custom board.

n-Queen
First, the user will be asked to supply the value for n. An empty board will be shown. The board size is customizable from 3 < size < 11. Next the user will enter the positions of the n queens. A board with the n Queens will be shown. SUCCESS will be shown if no queens are attacking each other. FAIL if there are queens attacking each other.
